A drupal module and TVDB.com API library

What? 
Whichep is a module that does one thing (at this stage) - given the name of a 
TV series, it will suggest a random episode of the show to watch giving a season
number, episode number and episode title. This fills a very specific use case
for those who enjoy a TV series in non-chronologic order...

How?
A drupal module and a standalone PHP wrapper around the TVDB.com API (or the parts I need).

TODO:
- Integrate drupal caching into the API calls to speed things up.
- Investigate possibility of using AJAX to return results.
- Add proper exception throwing/handling to API.
